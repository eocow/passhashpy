# passhashpy Password Hash and Login System
User will input if they are logging in or registering through CLI promt
It then takes their password input, creates a sha256 hash in a hex format then either appends that to the txt file or checks if the hash exits

This was a fun project for me to learn and get comfortable with python and project development in general. Also want to play with hashing rather than just plain text
